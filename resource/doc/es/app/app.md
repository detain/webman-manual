# Plugins for Applications

> The application plugins require webman >= 1.4.0

## Concept
Build your own application quickly, like assembling building blocks.

## Introduction
In fact, application plugins are complete applications that can be installed as plugins into the main project, enabling the main project to quickly obtain certain module functionalities. For example, if the main project needs a Q&A system, it can install a Q&A application plugin, or if it needs a shopping mall system, it can install a shopping mall application plugin. All plugins are independent and can be used immediately, and can be easily deleted when not needed.

## Impact
Application plugins greatly enhance the reusability of webman projects. Any developer can transform their own projects into plugins and offer them for installation in other projects, benefiting those projects and earning revenue for themselves.

## Earning Revenue
webman provides an official [application market](https://www.workerman.net/apps), where developers can submit the applications they have developed and earn revenue from them.
