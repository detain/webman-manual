# Application plugins

> Application plugins require webman>=1.4.0

## Concept
Build your own application quickly as if assembling building blocks.

## Introduction
Application plugins are actually complete applications that can be installed as plugins into the main project, allowing the main project to rapidly acquire specific module functionalities. For example, if the main project needs a Q&A system, it can install a Q&A application plugin. If it needs an e-commerce system, it can install an e-commerce application plugin. All plugins do not interfere with each other, they are plug-and-play, and can be removed with just one click when not needed.

## Impact
Application plugins greatly enhance the reusability of the webman project. Any developer can transform their own project into a plugin and provide it for installation in other projects, benefiting those projects and themselves.

## Earning Revenue
Webman provides an official [app market](https://www.workerman.net/apps), where developers can submit their developed applications to the market and earn revenue from it.
