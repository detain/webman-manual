# Application Plugins

> Application plugins require webman>=1.4.0

## Concept
Build your own application quickly like building blocks.

## Introduction
An application plugin is actually a complete application that can be installed as a plugin into the main project, allowing the main project to quickly gain a specific module or functionality. For example, if the main project needs a Q&A system, you can install a Q&A application plugin. If you need a shopping mall system, you can install a shopping mall application plugin. All plugins are independent and can be used immediately without affecting each other. They can be easily removed when not needed.

## Impact
Application plugins greatly improve the reusability of webman projects. Developers can transform their own projects into plugins and provide them to other projects for installation, benefiting other projects and gaining profits themselves.

## Earning Profits
webman provides an official [Application Marketplace](https://www.workerman.net/apps), where developers can submit their developed applications and earn profits from them.
