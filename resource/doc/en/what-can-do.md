# What can webman do

## Traditional web sites
webman provides a complete MVC architecture and can be used to develop traditional web sites.

## HTTP interfaces
In addition to being used for developing traditional web sites, webman is also particularly suitable for providing RPC services or microservices as HTTP interfaces to the outside world.

## Others
webman provides custom process functionality, which can be used to implement any server-side program, such as instant messaging services, IoT, game servers, and microservices, similar to workerman.
